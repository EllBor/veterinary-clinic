**redux-slice** - utility library to help reduce boilerplate code in
Shipa Redux-based Separation of Concerns implementation (SReSC).

# Use
1. Install.
```
npm i @shipae/redux-slice
```
2. Use in code to auto generate reducer and actions for application module.
```
import { createSlice, Action } from 'src/application/slice-util';

type CounterPayload = number | undefined;
export type CounterAction = Action<CounterPayload>;
export type CounterState = {
  value: number,
};

export const {
  reducer,
  actions: {
    incrementCounter,
    decrementCounter,
    updateCounter,
  },
} = createSlice<CounterState, CounterPayload>(
  { value: 0 },
  [
    { type: 'incrementCounter' },
    { type: 'decrementCounter' },
    { type: 'updateCounter', field: 'value' },
  ],
);
```

# Concept
In SReSC all logic sits in redux middlewares so nor reducer neither action
should newer contain any logic which means both turn almost completely into
boilerplate code. This also means that any action creator can have the same
shape, for example:
```
updateCounter = (payload) => ({
  type: 'updateCounter',
  payload,
});
```
Its just a payload that changes but the action itself and action creator
are always the same. Payload can be anything that is why lib also exports
Action type which has typescript generic Payload:
```
type Action<Payload> = {
  type: string,
  payload: Payload,
};
```

# Improve project
1. `npm i` - install dependencies
2. `npm run dev` - start typescript type checker
3. (optional) `npm run jest` - start jest in watch mode
